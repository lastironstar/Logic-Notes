"In a formal axiomatic system deduction is more of a mechanical process, so it is less prone to human errors. 
Such a deduction, now called a derivation, can be checked in a purely combinatorial way by checking whether 
formal rules of construction and inference have been obeyed. In contrast, the situation in a non-formal 
axiomatic system is quite different: There, a proof is a mental process that involves the meaning of the 
constituents of the proof and the relations between them. As such the proof is vulnerable and prone to errors 
because of man’s subjective capability of realisation as to whether an inference is valid." - Borut Robič.
